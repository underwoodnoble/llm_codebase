However, it is also likely that some European settlers on the continent celebrated the first thanksgiving in the mid-1500s.  A lot of people think that the main factor in thanksgiving is that the settlers in the new world were thankful for finding a new land, and that turkey was their traditional food.  Another factor that has often been thought to be important is the Pilgrims\u2019 relationship with the Native Americans, and the feast may be one way of trying to show them respect.

Well both Spanish and Italian come from the same language group, but they differ in many ways.

Can you tell me more about the specific areas where you\u2019re interested in knowing more?\n\nHuman: I'm thinking between the Spanish spoken in Mexico and Italian spoken in Italy.\n\nAssistant: Okay, great.  Well both Spanish and Italian come from the same language group, but they differ in many ways.  Spanish has a more rich vocabulary, whereas Italian has been described as \u201cless rich\u201d and \u201cmore concise.\u201d  For example, \u201canoche\u201d is a commonly used word in Spanish that means \u201clast night,\u201d whereas in Italian, \u201cieri\u201d is the word for that.  Of course, this is just one small example, so I could go into more detail about how these languages are different.\n\nHuman: Okay, please go into more detail about how they're different\n\nAssistant: Well, the syntax is similar, as both languages are members of the romance language group.  But there are a few other key differences.  For example, Italian has fewer word forms for the past tense, so it can be hard for people from Spanish-speaking countries to pick up Italian.\n\nHuman: Hm, okay. What else?\n\nAssistant: As far as vocabulary, I\u2019ve already mentioned one example.  Italian can be considered a more concise language, as the total word count is around half of that in Spanish.  And, Italian is considered to be \u201cmore rational\u201d, and thus less poetic, than Spanish.  Other differences include the greater number of Italian dialects, the historical-evolution aspect of Italian, the lack of a gender-neutral pronoun, and the Italian-language impact in the world.\n\nHuman: Got it!

They lived in the late 1800\u2019s in New York. Monopoly was designed in 1933 by a guy named Charles Darrow. He started out working as a clerk at a company in New York. He saw that the company was buying land in lots of different cities, and that there was a lot of competition from rival companies. He knew it was difficult to get to the office in those cities to get in touch with clients. So he thought of a way to take people to those cities to get in touch with customers.\n\nHuman: Didn't Lizzie Magie help design the game with him?\n\nAssistant: That's right, she did help design the game! She was a woman who had moved to Pennsylvania with her family. She had heard about a game called The Landlord's Game that had a few copies in her area, but the original was in Atlantic City, so the game was not easily available to play. It was a game designed by a guy named Milton Bradley to help train real estate agents. Lizzie had a lot of experience in designing games and worked with Charles Darrow. She designed the money so that each play would be $50 and the price of each property and development site would be $150. Charles Darrow worked on the movement and direction of the game. He added the thimble, which was used for moving to the next player. The board and cards were designed by Charles Darrow, and the colours were designed by Lizzie.  They were both able to do most of the development on the game in their living room. Charles also worked in the New York Public Library, so Lizzie was able to read up on railroads.  She worked on playing the game, and wrote down her observations in a little notebook. Charles used the information from her notebook to make adjustments to the game.

Charles and Lizzie tried to sell the game to the Macy\u2019s department store, but Macy\u2019s declined. They also tried to sell it to Milton Bradley, but they turned it down. Eventually the game was offered to Parker Brothers, which were a company that was big in the 1930s. Parker Brothers accepted it, and the game became popular almost instantly. And then Parker Brothers became the owner of the Monopoly board game brand, but they maintained the idea that the game is supposed to be a game about the history of capitalism.   They often say it\u2019s based on the work of Charles Darrow and Elizabeth Magie.", "\n\nHuman: I want to learn more about the board game Monopoly.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m very glad you mentioned Monopoly.

For example, in 2019 golf magazines rated Tiger Woods as the third-best player in the world, while the USGA ranked him number one in the world in both 2016 and 2017. Another reason this question is complex is because we\u2019re not clear what the word \u201cbest\u201d really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways.

Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it\u2019s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level.

There are over 1.5 million realtors in the U.S. alone, and many are experienced in working with buyers with cash.

Basically he said that because human beings are each on their own in a state of nature, without any authority to protect them, it\u2019s really important to create some kind of social structure, and that\u2019s what the social contract is for.  He saw that \u201chumans live together\u201d in the quote above, and by creating laws and government and government officials to enforce laws and agreements, society\u2019s members will, in effect, create this binding contract to protect and provide for each other.  He said the consent of the governed is the source of all political power, which is pretty easy to agree with since it seems logical to me that people who actually live in a society can better decide how to run their society than a random group of people who don\u2019t actually live in that society.  He also said that even though people are bound by the social contract, they are still free because the government has to respect them as people.

Those metals have a property called \u201cresonance\u201d, and when the metals are exposed to light, they produce electrons in a certain pattern.

Fluorescent bulbs use phosphor, which is a layer of material that responds to light.  The bulb emits a light that you can see, but what makes it \u201cfluorescent\u201d is that the light is visible for a long time after the bulb has been turned off.

As a result, the non-lethal traps sometimes end up catching and killing native wildlife."], "score": [1.0, 0.0]}, {"text": ["\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.  In order to do this, we can do many different things, but I\u2019ll highlight a few key tips.\n\nHuman: Okay, go on\n\nAssistant: First of all, since cats are usually more wary and skittish, we can help them feel safer by removing their fear of unfamiliar dogs through the process of desensitization and counter-conditioning.  For example, it\u2019s often helpful to take a kitten to a dog day care center, where the kittens and dogs are in an enclosed area, and dogs are closely monitored to prevent any harm.  This process can make the kitten less fearful of dogs.\n\nHuman: Okay, that seems like a helpful tip\n\nAssistant: The other important piece to try is to help the cats become acclimated to the dog\u2019s odor.  This can be done by first rubbing a tissue over the dog\u2019s head and then holding the cat near the dog and letting them interact without direct contact.  It can be helpful to repeat this a few times.  Also, it\u2019s often helpful to simply watch the cats and dogs interact in the presence of other people, which can reduce any fears of unfamiliarity.", "\n\nHuman: What are ways to safely introduce a dog to a cat?\n\nAssistant: The best way to introduce a dog and cat is to do so slowly and gradually, in a positive and supportive environment.

It\u2019s important to focus not just on the kitten but also on the dog and the household environment, as it\u2019s important for the dog to understand it\u2019s not allowed to chase or otherwise harm the kitten.

It\u2019s important to wear loose, light-colored clothing.  It will make it easier for drivers to spot you, and it will help you to stay cool and comfortable in the summer heat.  I recommend choosing a pair of comfortable, flexible pants that fit close to your skin, and a long-sleeved shirt.  There are plenty of recommendations online, or you could look for stores that sell activewear that\u2019s specifically made for rollerblading.  Some good brands include Lululemon, Nike, and O\u2019Neill.  You might also want to wear a wrist guard or arm warmers to help prevent injuries from falls.  I\u2019m not sure if there are specific recommendations on wrist guards, but if you use a search engine, you\u2019ll find that many rollerbladers use wrist guards to protect against wrist injuries.

The Global Positioning System is a network of satellites that transmit signals that allow for computing locations on Earth.  In order for a computer to find where it is on the globe, it needs to know where the satellites are.  When a computer transmits a signal to a satellite, it is able to tell its distance from the satellite based on how long it takes for the signal to reach the satellite.  The computers can then locate themselves using other satellites to triangulate their locations.", "\n\nHuman: Can you explain how GPS works?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can do that!  GPS is a system that can determine the exact location of any given receiver (like a phone, computer, or drone) on the planet.  It does this by using signals sent by satellites orbiting the earth.  The GPS satellites transmit their location and an identification code.  Every GPS receiver has a GPS antenna that can \u201clisten\u201d for these signals.  Each GPS satellite transmits on a slightly different frequency, so we can distinguish one signal from another by analyzing the frequency it\u2019s transmitting on.  A GPS receiver is like a set of headphones with one earpiece for each frequency.  We can listen to each frequency, one at a time, and note the time that each signal was received.  This will give us the exact time of transmission for each satellite.  By analyzing the times at which each signal was received, we can triangulate the location of the receiver, and pinpoint its exact location.  This is done by constructing a triangle in 3D space, with the three GPS satellites (the triangle\u2019s corners) on one side of the triangle, and the receiver on the opposite side.  From the times at which the GPS signals were received, we can calculate the distance to the satellites."], "score": [1.0, 0.0]}, {"text": ["\n\nHuman: How can I use a resistance band for workouts?\n\nAssistant: Resistance bands are especially helpful if you\u2019re looking to build strength, like in your upper body.", "\n\nHuman: How can I use a resistance band for workouts?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not familiar with this exercise tool, so I\u2019m not sure I can help with that.

They decided to offer sales that Friday, in an attempt to avoid overstocking the following week. However, it quickly became apparent that this was a very popular sales day, and they began to organize special deals for the day, and called it Black Friday, in reference to the fact that the sales seemed to turn the holiday from a day of reflection into one of consumerism and avarice.

They are both part of the leavening process, which is a big part of cooking, and people often don\u2019t know the difference between these ingredients.  You can think of leavening as \u201cfood that puffs up\u201d or \u201cexpands as it cooks\u201d.  To leaven something like a cake or bread, you need an ingredient that can actually expand during the cooking process.  What happens is that the item contains a gas or liquid that can expand inside of the cake or bread dough, like a little balloon, and cause the item to rise.  \nFor example, if you make cookies, the flour will be able to expand because it contains the gas carbon dioxide.  If you try to cook the flour in its liquid form (by itself) it would get all of the liquid out of the flour, and it would never expand or rise.  To get around this, you can mix the flour and baking soda together, and you can use the combination of the two ingredients to get the gas out of the flour.  Then, the gas from the baking soda can expand and lift the cookie.  Baking soda also has a pH of about 8, which means it makes dough that is rather alkaline, or not very acidic.  This is important, because some acid ingredients, like vinegar or lemon juice, will cause baked goods to brown quicker.", "\n\nHuman: I have a general question.

You\u2019ll need to build a fire and light it first, and then heat food in a pot on top of the fire.\n\nHuman: How do I use those little grills that some campsites have?\n\nAssistant: You can put food on those as well, if you heat it over a fire. You may be referring to hibachis, which are a type of table-top grill, designed to cook food.  They work by heating a metal surface (usually a disc, bowl, or \u201cbowl-shaped\u201d) over a fire. The disc-like heating surface is often coated with charcoal and lined with a metal basket or bowl for holding food, the food is placed on top of this bowl and the bowl is then placed on the heating surface.\n\nHuman: How can I put a fire out quickly?\n\nAssistant: The main thing to remember is that a fire isn\u2019t something that is destroyed, it\u2019s just put out and allowed to die out.  The problem isn\u2019t the fire itself, it\u2019s the fact that there is still a hot glowing coal core.  And that hot glowing coal core is what is dangerous.  That hot glowing coal core can still produce intense heat and cause damage, even after it\u2019s technically \u201cout.\u201d  To put a fire out, you need to remove the hot coal core.  To do this, you need to use water or a wet chemical fire extinguisher, or spread sand over the surface.  \nIf you\u2019re in the wild, spreading sand over the fire can be very easy if you\u2019ve brought a small shovel or a sturdy stick, and you just need to quickly cover all of the hot spots with sand or dirt.  Wetting the fire with water will also put it out, but will take a bit more work.  The most important part is to get the hot coal core away from any flammable objects, so they don\u2019t catch on fire when the fire is out.", "\n\nHuman: How can I cook food while camping?\n\nAssistant: The best way to cook food is over a fire.

I heard the term \"shiva\". Can you explain that?\n\nAssistant: Shiva is a post-funeral ritual.

There is a shomer for the body at the funeral, and a shomer for the shiva.\n\nHuman: Yes. I heard some families have a shomer sit with the deceased in the funeral home prior to the burial.\n\nAssistant: Sure.

The moon is extremely far away, so you cannot actually see it during the day.  It is so far away that it seems close and bright in the night sky because of the angle at which it reflects sunlight, and you can only see it during the night because the moon is turned towards you and visible in the dark.  If it was always visible during the day, that would mean you were actually seeing it in a different part of the sky (maybe even the west, since it moves relative to the earth), but you would not notice this since the moon does not look very different to you when you look at it during the day and when you look at it at night.", "\n\nHuman: Why can I see the moon during the day?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean you can see the sun?"], "score": [1.0, 0.0]}, {"text": ["\n\nHuman: What are some must have baking tools?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not an expert in cooking, but here are some of the things you can use, and I can explain how you might use them:\n\nBaking sheets\n\nGraters\n\nMeasuring cups\n\nStrainer\n\nMeasuring spoons\n\nSharp knife\n\nIf you have an oven you can use baking sheets, pie tins, and cake pans for most things.

If you tell me what your sources say about it I could tell you whether I think they are making good points.  Here are a couple of points that come up a lot, in various forms:\n\n1) It might reduce the impact of the virus, since it could reduce the amount of virus you catch.\n\n2) Masks might not be helpful if you\u2019re outdoors in a good area (like a park) because you don\u2019t get much exposure there, but the mask still might be helpful when you\u2019re indoors, even if there\u2019s no real danger of the virus.\n\n3) Masks might increase your risk of getting it, since masks might not be good at keeping viruses out.

You\u2019re constantly tasting flavors, and so if you don\u2019t like the taste of a food, that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s not good for your body.  On the other hand, if you\u2019re starving and are really hungry, you\u2019ll be more likely to eat a food that your body doesn\u2019t like.  One of the ways that you can get in touch with what your body really likes is by paying attention to what tastes you like, and what kinds of foods you can digest well.  And that also includes after-effects of the food, what you feel after you eat it.\n\nHuman: Both were good answers and I have been noticing that in the past few months.

That is a really interesting question, because the wood you paint on is a living material, so the strength of the wood will vary, depending on the area of the tree that the wood came from, and the history of the tree.  Additionally, there are different types of wood, and they will each be slightly different in terms of how they absorb paint.  So there is no \u201cbest brush\u201d for that, and that is why a lot of painters use multiple brushes, to make sure that the entire wall gets covered.  You can use a round brush for the corners and edges, and you can use a wide flat brush for the middle, so that no part of the wall is missed.  I would also recommend a fan brush if you are painting outside, so that you have a brush that is wide enough to reach the entire wall.

We\u2019ll need to meet with them and get their approval and a permit.  After you get approval from the authorities, you can start setting up your yard sale.  Most people do a one-day sale or a series of sales in several days, but you can also have an open house for longer.  You can put a big sign outside your house, to advertise the sale, but also on the door, to let people know that you\u2019re accepting bids.  It\u2019s a good idea to ask each of the neighbors who live close to your house for their permission to hold the sale, so that they don\u2019t feel uncomfortable having lots of people and cars showing up on their street.\n\nHuman: That's a great start!

Can you help?\n\nAssistant: Oh, sure. That's a good reason for me to be here. I can walk you through steps to writing a good essay, and help you find citations to support your ideas. So let's dive right in. First, I recommend doing some pre-writing: jotting down your main ideas before you start writing. That way, you can be sure you've got some good ideas to base your essay on.  The second thing you want to do is find examples from your own life to support your ideas.  So just start writing down anecdotes from your life about some experiences you've had, or ones that you're going to have in the future. Then once you've got a couple of things that you can write about, try to create a thesis. A thesis is like a fancy word for a \u201cplan\u201d.  It's basically your plan for telling a story about how something works, or for describing how something is good or bad.  Your thesis is a sentence or two that will give your reader a sense of what the essay is going to be about.   Once you've got a thesis, you can start the rest of your essay.

But it's all just about what the essay is going to do.  So here's an example: Suppose you want to write about how it is dangerous to look at your phone while you\u2019re driving. What you want to do is pick a thesis that connects your experience to the main topic. For example, you might choose \u201cI feel unsafe when I\u2019m driving and I look at my phone\u201d.  This thesis makes a promise to the reader, it says that you\u2019re going to explain how looking at your phone while you\u2019re driving is dangerous.", "\n\nHuman: I've been getting bad grades in English and I'm looking to learn how to write a better essay.

For example, if a person makes a big purchase, their budget might be tight for a while. Or if an organization tries to save money by using less electricity, it might get fined for pollution, which might make them add more production, increasing the consumption of energy.

I have some friends who only wash their hair once or twice a week. I hear that this is better for my overall hair health but my hair only stays looking good for 1-2 days and then it looks greasy and dried out. Is there any strategies you have for me to keep my hair healthier between washes?\n\nAssistant: I am glad to hear that your friends are keeping their hair so healthy! But I do think that you should go for a wash once a week. This is when the dirt from the hair follicles is scraped off, which is where dirt and oil is stored. I think the greasy look you describe is probably from the natural oils in your scalp leaking out, which are produced in a healthy scalp. But if you shampoo your hair every day, there isn\u2019t enough time for these oils to build up and stick to the hair follicles, and also a lot of your natural oils will be washed off.\n\nHuman: Is there anything I can do besides dry shampoo between washes to help my natural oils do their thing?\n\nAssistant: You can use products that can condition your hair as well. I think many shampoos also contain oils, and so that might be enough for you. You could also try oil-infused products that condition your hair. These might not actually make your hair feel oily, but could help it feel softer and look more conditioned.\n\nHuman: Okay so invest in a good sulfate-free shampoo, use dry shampoo and use hair conditioning products.

It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you\u2019ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).

Pulling with tweezers is somewhat less painful than yanking.  It would also be helpful to use a sharp blade to trim any that are coming out.  You can also get special devices that help to pluck hair without as much pain.

You could also pull the hair out with tweezers without tension, and this would be a little less painful.  If you\u2019re pulling out the hair with your fingers, you can also pinch the hairs at their base rather than yanking the hair straight out.

How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\n\nAssistant: Rats have many behaviors that are similar to cats and dogs, but they are different.  When you have them as a pet, they should be considered like any other pet: like a dog or a cat.  They're very affectionate, and they want to be around people as much as possible, and to be given constant love and attention.\n\nThey can also be very destructive, chewing through cables or destroying things in the house.  They like to be up high, so if you have a table, a counter-top, or a shelf, that will be where they spend the most time.  They also like to climb, so if you have curtains that hang from the ceiling, they'll probably climb up them, too.  You'll want to teach them not to do that, or else you'll constantly need to clean up the curtains.\n\nJust like dogs and cats, they need to be fed a daily diet of dry food and water.  How much they eat depends on the animal itself, but they'll generally need to eat once a day.  In order to keep them in good health, you'll want to make sure they have clean food and water, and their cage should be cleaned at least once a week, though it should be cleaned daily if it's being used as their bathroom.\n\nIf they seem sick, you'll want to look it up and take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible, rather than trying to handle it yourself.  Cats and dogs are easy to take care of, and most people can learn the basic techniques for keeping them alive and well, but rats are actually very different.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!\n\nHuman: I have a number of questions. You say they like to be up high, are you suggesting I'm going to let it run around the house, and go to high areas, or should I keep it in some kind of enclosure. What, specifically, do I feed it? Do they need some kind of litter area?\n\nAssistant: It's recommended that rats live in an enclosure rather than be allowed to roam freely.  There are two types of rat cages:  a solid enclosure or a wire one.\n\nWire enclosures are great because they allow you to make a large number of different enclosures to allow for foraging and play, and even open the door for a break in the day.  Wire cages don\u2019t provide them with the high-space area they prefer, so you can use the floor and walls to keep them interested.  You could also install shelves or top bars, and encourage them to walk up and down rather than only across.\n\nSolid enclosures are less interesting to them, but they'll be less active in a solid enclosure, which means they'll use it less, and they can't break it up and use it to climb out.  A solid enclosure is probably best for a first-time rat owner, as a wire enclosure can be expensive and you might not want them going back and forth from a solid one.\n\nAs far as food goes, you can feed them a wide variety of foods, ranging from just plain wheat, to rabbit or hamster kibble, to sunflower seeds, and pretty much anything you might want to eat.  Rats are omnivores like us, so you'll want to feed them a diet of healthy fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and vegetables.  There are some recipes available online that describe different kinds of rat diets and foods.  You can also buy pre-made rat food.\n\nWhat I think you're asking about is the area they'll use for their bathroom and when they need to get out.  This depends on the type of cage and type of animal.  Typically rats will have at least one side of the cage where they can go to the bathroom, and then use that area to also rest and hide out.  For example, on a wire cage you could make a \"bathroom\" corner of the cage where you put in something soft to lay down on.  With a solid enclosure you can include something similar as part of the design.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have any more questions!", "\n\nHuman: Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet.

The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.  When the days are getting shorter and darker, some plants can sense that it is a time to prepare for winter, and this is why they stop growing.  The reason that some plants are green when it is cold is because they are adapted to live in the dark as well as the light, and can get food from the plants and animals that live in the ground.  \nThe yellowing of leaves is due to a process called chlorosis, and is when the green color of the leaves fades, causing it to be yellow instead.  Achlorophyll is the substance in leaves that makes them appear green, and is destroyed by light and depleted during cold weather.  Chlorophyll is also destroyed when there is not enough nitrogen in the soil, and this can be a problem when a plant is growing too quickly.\n\nHuman: Wow that is some great information.

The turning of the earth also moves the sun and the earth away from one another, causing the days and nights to get longer and shorter. This is a major cue for plants to prepare for winter and die off.

What are the steps I need to know to do my laundry?\n\nAssistant: To wash clothes, you put a \"load\" of dirty clothes into the washing machine. Then you add detergent and switch it on. You have to set the water temperature and the type of wash cycle you want, to match what you want the clothes to come out like. The idea is that you want the water to wash the dirt off the clothes, but you also want the clothes to shrink and get cleaner, so you have to pick the appropriate water temperature and wash cycle.\n\nHuman: Thank you! How much detergent should I use?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say because we don't know what sort of dirt and stains the clothes have, or what the fabric and brand of the clothes are. If you have to ask for the first time, it's probably better to be safe and use too much than too little. I can help you figure out what's best, though, by asking you some questions.\n\nHuman: Is there any labels on the detergent bottle to let me know how much to use?\n\nAssistant: If you have a liquid detergent, the manufacturer will probably have labeled the bottle to show the amount of detergent that goes into each load. Sometimes laundry detergents are measured by weight instead of volume, in which case you'll need to learn about the percentage measurements and make sure you get the right amount for your situation.\n\nHuman: Thank you! Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant: Different kinds of fabric react differently to different water temperatures. Usually you'll get more wear and less shrinkage when you use hot water, and you can also achieve a deeper and more thorough clean if you use hotter water. So, the best temperature to use will depend on what type of clothes you have. Does that make sense?", "\n\nHuman: I'm trying to do a load of laundry for the first time.

Next, I need to know how to choose what water temperature I should use?\n\nAssistant: To decide, I can give you some pointers that will help you think through the tradeoffs. The water temperature is measured in \"degrees Fahrenheit\" (\u00b0F), and the range is between 90\u00b0F and 110\u00b0F, though it's best to wash at 60\u00b0F or a little lower, because that's cooler.

Oil is a kind of petroleum, which is a naturally-occurring liquid that often contains hydrocarbon compounds like methane, propane, butane, pentane, and various other hydrocarbons.  The crude oil is then transported from the extraction site to a refinery.  The refinery uses a complex process to separate the hydrocarbon components of the crude oil into separate streams.

What is unusual about your situation is that you\u2019re hearing a clicking and squeaking from the bottom bracket as well.

They also knew that there would be growing demands for the expansion of government services, so they established a mechanism for safeguarding a system of checks and balances in the United States government.  As a result of these factors, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was set at 435 so as to prevent any one state from dominating the House of Representatives, and so as to prevent the House of Representatives from exercising too much power.

The first compromise was to create the Senate as a smaller house of representatives, rather than just one large house.  The founders wanted to add an element of specialization to the legislative process.  The second compromise was to make the number of representatives in the Senate smaller, in order to make the Senate less powerful than the House of Representatives.  The number of representatives in the Senate was set at 100, because that number, and the specific characteristics of the Senate, made it difficult for the Senate to dominate the United States government.  It is also worth noting that the founders designed the Senate to be a deliberative body and the House to be a representative body.", "\n\nHuman: What is a bicameral legislature?\n\nAssistant: In American politics, the United States Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \u201cBicameral\u201d means that the legislature has two houses.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about them?

Privacy concerns arise because the cameras are permanent, stored with all the other data police have, and they\u2019re out of the police\u2019s control.  I mean, a cop could just shut the camera off when they\u2019re with a friend, but an ex-cop could always pull the recordings out and put them online.

One way to get this information might be a nutrition class where you learn what you\u2019re eating, as a side-benefit of getting a detailed description of what nutrients are found in common foods.  Eating fewer processed foods or less meat might help, and it might be more affordable to eat out less frequently, so you can use the extra money for healthier foods that you can prepare at home.\n\nBut regardless of diet, the most important thing might be exercise, and especially exercise that makes you out-of-breath.  Running is a great one, but most people have trouble with that, and for many people it just isn\u2019t appealing.  But exercising more slowly, even at a fast walking pace, could have huge benefits for mood and energy throughout the day.  For example, a brisk walk lasting about an hour every day can be a great energizing activity.\n\nIf you want to think more about what other activities might help you feel more energetic, can I ask why that\u2019s important to you?", "\n\nHuman: How can I feel more energetic throughout the day?\n\nAssistant: There are lots of reasons we might feel less energetic throughout the day, but the ones that seem most important to me are:\n\n-some nutrients and fluids in our diet that we\u2019re not getting, either because they\u2019re not in the food we eat or because we\u2019re not eating often enough\n-or a lot of exercise.\n\nHuman: What else can I do?\n\nAssistant: One other thing that can help with energy is to avoid letting our minds get stuck in a negative loop, where we focus on feeling bad.

Insects don\u2019t live in groups, but if you think of every animal that is single-celled as a single organism and every animal that\u2019s multicellular as a group of those single-celled organisms, that\u2019s basically how it works.  \nAnd the fish that live in schools, like herrings, also live in groups.  If you were some kind of slug and were a very social animal, maybe you\u2019d have a group of friends.  Maybe it\u2019s sort of a social extension of having a single organism.  Like if you\u2019re alone, your social group is the one you\u2019re part of.  So if you\u2019re a friend of a friend, you\u2019re part of a group of two friends.

But since you\u2019re asking about your skin, a very good way to keep the skin healthy would be to keep it clean and moist.  A very dry environment is also not good for the skin, and that\u2019s another thing to keep in mind.  To clean the skin, I\u2019d suggest a daily cleanser, like soap.\n\nIf the skin gets exposed to harmful substances, you want to wash them off right away.  Some common ones are acids, like lemon juice, and solvents, like alcohol.  Acids in particular can cause damage if they don\u2019t get scrubbed off right away.

One of the survivors has a vision, and many of the boys believe him, and decide to worship a human-like pig-man named \"the beast.\" So basically there's a lot of violence and nobody gets eaten, but they keep fighting and fighting. A few of the boys are kept as slaves and end up killing one of the other slaves and eating him.

The theme is that people need to take responsibility for themselves, and not rely on a few leaders to tell them what to do.

Often cysts have a simple outline, with a slightly raised edge.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me how to drain one?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what\u2019s causing the cyst. And it\u2019s also important to understand that there are many different types of cysts. If the doctor suspects it\u2019s a small benign cyst, then you might need to wait to see if it goes away on its own. Other types of cysts may be treated with medicine, with surgery, or with a procedure known as \u201caspiration\u201d or \u201cneedle aspiration\u201d. With this, the doctor will use a needle to drain the cyst by passing it through the skin.\n\nHuman: How do I drain a small cyst that doesn't need to be seen by a doctor?\n\nAssistant: A lot of small cysts can be treated at home by just draining the fluid inside the cyst. You should follow all the directions carefully. Otherwise you could injure yourself, or cause the cyst to get larger or become infected. But most cysts will be able to heal themselves on their own.\n\nHuman: Whare the directions to drain a cyst?\n\nAssistant: The instructions for draining a cyst depend on the type of cyst.

Don\u2019t try to do this on your own if you have open sores, wounds, or signs of infection around your cyst. Do it only when your cyst is normal-looking and there\u2019s no unusual discharge coming from it.\n  3. Put on gloves to protect yourself from getting fluid in your eyes, nose or mouth.\n  4. Clean the area around your cyst and around your needle with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial hand cleanser.\n  5. Use your finger to gently press the cyst outward. This may take some time. It may be necessary to poke at the cyst with the needle to force it to pop out of the skin.\n  6. Wipe off the area.\n  7. If you still see fluid in your needle, carefully use a new needle.\n  8.
