The first method is by using carbon-14 dating, which is used to date human-made objects. However, this method is not effective for dinosaur bones because the half-life of carbon-14 is only ~5730 years [1]. The second method is by using uranium-238, uranium-235, and potassium-40 isotopes, each of which has a half-life of more than a million years [1]. Unfortunately, these elements don't exist in dinosaur fossils themselves, but each of them typically exists in igneous rock, which is rock made from cooled magma [2]. However, igneous rock isn't usually found in the same rock layers as sedimentary rock, which is where dinosaur fossils are found [2]. Therefore, to approximate the age of sedimentary rock layers, researchers have to find layers of earth that include igneous rock, such as volcanic ash, which are like bookends and can help pin down the age of the sedimentary layers between them [2].", "## Human:\nHow do scientists determine the age of dinosaur bones?\n\nis it 100% accurate or more of a guess? please explain like I'm 5.\n\n## Assistant:\nThere are several different methods that scientists can use to determine the approximate age of dinosaur bones.

However, in a reactor there are other things that start and sustain the chain reaction, such as a moderator [1]. In all commercial reactors in the United States, the moderator is plain old water [1]. Some reactors use heavy water and others use graphite [1]. Either way, the function is critical for (most) nuclear reactors [1]. When a U-235 nucleus absorbs an extra neutron, it quickly breaks into two parts, which is known as fission [2]. Each time a U-235 nucleus splits, it releases two or three neutrons, which allows for a chain reaction [2]. The rate of fissions in the uranium nuclei in the MIT reactor is controlled by control blades of boron-stainless steel which are inserted vertically alongside the fuel elements [3]. Boron has the property of absorbing neutrons without re-emitting any, so when the control blades are fully inserted, they absorb so many neutrons from the uranium that there aren't enough to allow a chain reaction to continue [3].

In this example, scientists were able to introduce cougars into the population to breed with the panthers, thus helping the population become stable and genetically healthy again [3].

For instance, a function that is constant inside the interval and zero elsewhere is called a rectangular window, which describes the shape of its graphical representation [2]. When another function or a signal (data) is multiplied by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap; the \"view through the window\" [2]. In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, \"bell-shaped\" curves [3]. Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used [3].", "## Human:\nThe really simple version of windowing\n\nSo my trainwreck of a DSP class hasn't really been going well for me, it seems like the professor doesn't provide any context for what we are learning and it would be a better use of my time to just copy articles from wikipedia.

High-resolution, low-dynamic-range windows such as the rectangular window also have the property of high **sensitivity**, which is the ability to reveal relatively weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows. [1]\n\nAt the other extreme of the range of window types are windows with high dynamic range but low resolution and sensitivity. High-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in wideband applications, where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes.

When the observer is moving towards the source, the frequency gets higher (approach), and when the observer is moving away from the source, the frequency gets lower (recession) [1][2].

It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842. [1][2] A common example of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.  The reason for the Doppler effect is that when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the crest of the previous wave. Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Hence, the time between the arrivals of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency.

Melatonin is a hormone that controls our internal clock, as well as many other functions in our bodies [1]. When there is less light input to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the production of melatonin increases, signaling to our brains that it is time to sleep [1]. Other body functions also follow a daily rhythm, and many of them are controlled by hormones and other compounds [1].

Cold temperatures can lead to dehydration of mucus and dry nostrils and airways, which could make it easier for the viruses to make themselves at home once they're passed to us [1]. Additionally, humans and many other mammals experience seasonal physiological changes, often tied to the light/dark cycle [4]. In the winter, any number of tweaks to our immunity - such as a decrease in vitamin D production - could make us more susceptible to the virus [4]. One interesting theory is that the reason we get sick more often in the winter is because cold weather leads to our blood vessels in our nose constricting, which reduces our ability to fight infection [5].", "## Human:\nWhy does being cold make us catch a cold?\n\n[removed]\n\n## Assistant:\nThe human body goes through seasonal physiological changes tied to the light/dark cycle [2].

However, there are other factors that come into play in the winter as well. Cooler body temperatures cause the blood vessels in our nose and upper airways to constrict, which is what researchers believe inhibits our immune response and triggers cold symptoms [3].

[1]  Another theory is that humans have evolved to cry in order to relieve stress and reduce the levels of stress hormones in the body.  If this theory is correct, then crying could serve as an adaptive function in response to stress, in the same way that sweating helps cool us down when we are overheated. [3]  A third theory is that crying helped hunter gathers cultivate relationships and build trust.

We have retained from the Babylonians not only hours and minutes divided into 60, but also their division of a circle into 360 parts or degrees [1]. The definition of a day is the amount of time it takes an astronomical object to complete one full spin on its axis [2]. A day is 23 hours and 56 minutes, but other planets and bodies rotate at different rates [2]. This means that a day on the Moon is about 14 Earth days long and a \"night\" lasts the same time [2].

The Moon is gradually slowing the Earth's rotation because of friction produced by tides [1]. Over the course of a century, the length of a day increases by a couple of milliseconds [1]. However, 24 hours is the length of one Earth day on average [2]. The Earth's actual motion around the Sun varies from a low of 29.3 km/s to a high of 30.3 km/s, which factors in to the length of our days varying by about \u00b14 seconds throughout the year [3]. The day is defined to be the time between one dawn (or noon) and the next, meaning the day is defined with respect to the position of the Sun in the sky [4].

How is this information interpreted and how does it generally work?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses guys!\n\n## Assistant:\nFibre optic cables work by using light particles, or photons, which travel in a bent pipe [3, 4]. These cables can carry telephone conversations, audio signals, and digital data [1]. In order to transmit this information, the analog voice signals are first translated into digital signals [1]. A laser at one end of the pipe switches on and off to send each bit of information [1]. The information is then transmitted down the line by equipment in huts every 40 to 60 miles [2]. The huts contain equipment that picks up and retransmits the signal down the next segment at full strength [2]. Light travels down the cable by bouncing off the walls of the cable repeatedly [3]. Each photon bounces down the pipe like a bobsleigh going down an ice run [3, 4]. If light hits glass at a shallow angle, it reflects back in again, in a phenomenon called total internal reflection [4]. This keeps the light inside the pipe [4].", "## Human:\nHow do fibre optic cables actually work?\n\nThe extent of my knowledge of fibre optic cables is simply that they carry light as forms of information.

The electronic signals that travel down the inner tube of the cable are in the form of bursts of light [3]. These signals travel down the core of the cable at a shallow angle, causing the light to bounce off the walls of the core rather than shine right through the glass [3].

Building a hexagonal honeycomb actually offers the most space using the least amount of wax.
